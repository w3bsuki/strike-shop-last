# Duplicate Navbar Fix Report

## Issue Found
The duplicate navbar issue was caused by the `ProductPageClient` component rendering its own `<SiteHeader />` component, while the parent `ProductPage` component was already rendering one.

## Root Cause
- File: `/app/product/[slug]/ProductPageClient.tsx`
- Line 143: The component was rendering `<SiteHeader />` 
- The parent component in `/app/product/[slug]/page.tsx` (line 111) was also rendering `<SiteHeader />`
- This resulted in two navigation headers appearing on product pages

## Fix Applied
1. **Removed duplicate SiteHeader from ProductPageClient.tsx**
   - Removed the `<SiteHeader />` component from the return statement
   - Changed wrapping element from `<main>` to a fragment `<>`
   - Removed unused imports for `SiteHeader` and `Footer`

2. **Cleaned up unused components**
   - Deleted the old `/components/header.tsx` file which was not being used
   - Updated test file to reference `SiteHeader` instead of the old `Header` component

## Verification
- Checked all other pages that use `SiteHeader` - they correctly render it only once at the page level
- The navigation structure is now consistent across the application:
  - Each page component renders `<SiteHeader />` once
  - Child components do not render their own headers
  - The SiteHeader component from `/components/navigation/site-header.tsx` is the single source of truth

## Pages Verified
- ✅ Home page (`/app/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Category pages (`/app/[category]/page.tsx`) 
- ✅ Product pages (`/app/product/[slug]/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Search page (`/app/search/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Wishlist page (`/app/wishlist/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Account page (`/app/account/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Checkout page (`/app/checkout/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Order confirmation page (`/app/order-confirmation/page.tsx`)

## Result
The duplicate navbar issue has been resolved. Product pages now display only one navigation header, consistent with the rest of the application.
