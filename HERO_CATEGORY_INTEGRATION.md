# Hero Category Bar Integration

## Overview
Integrated the category bar into the hero viewport to improve UX and reduce the need for scrolling. Removed duplicate category section.

## Changes Made

### 1. Hero Container Structure
- Changed hero wrapper to `h-screen flex flex-col` to contain both hero and categories
- Hero section now uses `flex-1` with constraints:
  - `minHeight: '60vh'` - Ensures hero is still prominent
  - `maxHeight: 'calc(100vh - 120px)'` - Leaves room for category bar

### 2. Category Bar Styling Updates
- **Background**: Changed from black to white for better contrast
- **Border**: Added 4px black border on top for visual separation
- **Desktop Grid**: 
  - Black boxes with white text (inverted from before)
  - Hover effect: Black → White with smooth transition
  - Reduced padding for more compact look
- **Mobile Scroll**:
  - Black boxes with rounded corners
  - More compact sizing

### 3. Removed Duplicate Category Section
- Deleted the CategoryCarousel section that was below the hero
- Users now see categories immediately without scrolling

### 4. Hero Content Positioning
- Changed from `items-end md:items-center` to `items-center` 
- Removed bottom padding since we have more controlled height
- Content is now always centered vertically

## Benefits

### User Experience
- **Immediate Category Visibility**: Users see navigation options without scrolling
- **Better Visual Hierarchy**: Categories are part of the hero experience
- **Reduced Page Height**: Less scrolling needed to reach products
- **Mobile Friendly**: Categories still accessible via horizontal scroll

### Design Improvements
- **Cleaner Layout**: No duplicate category sections
- **Better Use of Viewport**: Full screen utilized effectively
- **Visual Connection**: Categories feel integrated with hero, not separate

## Layout Breakdown
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐

│      HERO IMAGE/CONTENT     │  ← 60-80vh
│       (centered text)       │
│                             │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│  CATEGORY 1 │ CATEGORY 2 │  │  ← Fixed height
│  CATEGORY 3 │ CATEGORY 4 │  │    within viewport
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

## Result
The hero + category bar now work as a single cohesive landing experience that fits within the viewport, eliminating the need for immediate scrolling while maintaining visual impact.
