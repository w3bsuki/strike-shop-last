# THE ACTUAL FIX - DATABASE NOT CONNECTED

## THE PROBLEM
Your logs clearly show: `DATABASE_URL: Not set`

Medusa CANNOT start without a database. Period.

## THE SOLUTION

### 1. In Railway Dashboard:

1. **Add PostgreSQL to your project**:
   - Click "New" → "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
   - Wait for it to deploy (green status)

2. **Connect the database to your app**:
   - Click on your Medusa app service
   - Go to "Variables" tab
   - Click "Add Variable Reference"
   - Select "PostgreSQL" → "DATABASE_URL"
   - This creates: `DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}`

3. **Add these other required variables**:
   ```
   JWT_SECRET=your-secret-here-make-it-long
   COOKIE_SECRET=your-cookie-secret-here
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=9000
   HOST=0.0.0.0
   ```

### 2. Verify PostgreSQL is Running:
- The PostgreSQL service should show green/running status
- If not, click on it and check logs

### 3. Redeploy:
- Your app will automatically redeploy when you add variables
- Or manually trigger with "Redeploy" button

## Why This Keeps Failing

Without DATABASE_URL:
- Medusa can't connect to any database
- Stock_location module fails immediately
- Tax module fails
- Everything fails

## This Will Work Because:
- Railway's PostgreSQL provides the DATABASE_URL automatically
- The variable reference syntax `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}` links them
- Medusa will have a database to connect to

If you don't see PostgreSQL in your Railway project, you haven't added it yet!
