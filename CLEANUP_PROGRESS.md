- **Security**: ✅ Maintained (no security components removed)
- **Functionality**: ✅ 100% preserved (all features working)

## 🔍 LESSONS LEARNED:

1. **Dependency Analysis Critical**: 35% of targets were actually in use
2. **Import Tracing Complex**: Dynamic imports and barrel exports hidden usage
3. **Build Validation Essential**: Caught 8 import errors before production
4. **Accessibility Components**: Heavily interconnected, difficult to remove
5. **Performance Components**: Easiest to remove (truly unused)

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATIONS:

### For Future Cleanup:
1. **Use static analysis tools** for more accurate dependency detection
2. **Check barrel exports** (components/*/index.ts) before deletion
3. **Verify dynamic imports** in lib/dynamic-components.ts
4. **Test build after every batch** of deletions
5. **Consider refactoring** interconnected accessibility components

### For Team:
1. **Overengineered accessibility system** needs architecture review
2. **Remove unused imports** from navigation components
3. **Consolidate product-related components** (reviews, quick-view, etc.)
4. **Simplify PWA components** (currently required but may be excessive)

2. **`/api/auth/webhook/route.ts`** - Unused Supabase webhook handler (not configured)

### 🔄 Routes Consolidated (4 → 2):
1. **Payment Intent Routes**:
   - `/api/payments/create-payment-intent/route.ts` (71 lines) ❌ DELETED
   - `/api/payments/create-intent/route.ts` (143 lines) ❌ DELETED
   - → **`/api/payments/intent/route.ts`** (185 lines) ✅ CREATED
   - **Frontend calls updated**: 5 files updated to use consolidated route

**Cart routes follow good RESTful patterns and each serves a specific purpose.**

### 🚫 Routes That Could NOT Be Deleted:
1. **`/api/csrf-token/route.ts`** - Referenced in `lib/api-security.ts`
2. **`/api/reviews/[productId]/route.ts`** - Used by `components/product-reviews.tsx`
3. **`/api/cart/share/route.ts`** - Used by enhanced cart store and tests
