# CORS Critical Security Fix Report

**Date:** 2025-06-26  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** FIXED

## Executive Summary

Fixed critical CORS wildcard vulnerability in Medusa configuration that was blocking production deployment. The system was using wildcard (`*`) CORS origins by default, which would allow any website to access the API - a severe security vulnerability.

## Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. **Wildcard CORS in Production Configuration**
- **File:** `/medusa-config.production.ts`
- **Issue:** Default CORS values were set to `*` (wildcard)
- **Risk:** Any website could make requests to the API, exposing sensitive data and operations

### 2. **Lack of CORS Validation**
- **Issue:** No validation to prevent wildcards or invalid origins
- **Risk:** Misconfiguration could easily introduce security vulnerabilities

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. **Updated `/medusa-config.production.ts`**
- Added `parseAllowedOrigins` function that:
  - Rejects any wildcard (`*`) origins with security warnings
  - Validates URL format for all origins
  - Provides secure defaults if no valid origins are found
  - Throws an error if wildcards are detected in final configuration
- Default production origins set to:
  - `https://strike-shop.com`
  - `https://www.strike-shop.com`  
  - `https://api.strike-shop.com`
  - `https://admin.strike-shop.com`

### 2. **Updated `/medusa-config.js`**
- Added `parseAndValidateOrigins` function with same security checks
- Maintains separate development and production origin lists
- Development allows localhost origins for local testing
- Production enforces strict domain whitelisting

### 3. **Created `/scripts/verify-cors-config.js`**
A comprehensive CORS security validator that:
- Checks all configuration files for wildcard patterns
- Validates environment variables
- Ensures proper URL format for all origins
- Warns about non-HTTPS origins in production
- Provides detailed security report
- Exits with error code if critical issues found

### 4. **Created `/scripts/validate-production-env.js`**
Production environment validator that checks:
- CORS configuration (no wildcards)
- Security secrets (proper length and entropy)
- API keys format and production readiness
- Security headers and rate limiting
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- Generates detailed validation report

### 5. **Updated `.env.example`**
- Added explicit CORS configuration examples
- Added security warnings about wildcards
- Added production security flags:
  - `ENFORCE_PRODUCTION_SECURITY=true`
  - `REQUIRE_HTTPS_IN_PRODUCTION=true`
  - `BLOCK_LOCALHOST_IN_PRODUCTION=true`

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **No Wildcards Policy**: System throws errors if wildcards are detected
2. **URL Validation**: All origins must be valid URLs
3. **HTTPS Enforcement**: Production origins must use HTTPS
4. **Localhost Blocking**: Production can block localhost origins
5. **Default Security**: Secure defaults prevent accidental exposure
6. **Validation Scripts**: Automated checks prevent misconfigurations

## Usage Instructions

### Setting CORS Origins

1. **Environment Variables** (Recommended):
```bash
# Separate CORS for different services
STORE_CORS=https://strike-shop.com,https://www.strike-shop.com
ADMIN_CORS=https://admin.strike-shop.com
AUTH_CORS=https://strike-shop.com,https://admin.strike-shop.com

# Or use single variable for all
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://strike-shop.com,https://www.strike-shop.com,https://admin.strike-shop.com
```

2. **Validation Before Deployment**:
```bash
# Check CORS configuration
node scripts/verify-cors-config.js

# Full production validation
NODE_ENV=production node scripts/validate-production-env.js
```

### CI/CD Integration

Add to your deployment pipeline:
```yaml
- name: Validate CORS Configuration
  run: node scripts/verify-cors-config.js
  
- name: Validate Production Environment
  run: NODE_ENV=production node scripts/validate-production-env.js
```

## Testing

1. **Local Testing**:
```bash
# Should pass in development
NODE_ENV=development node scripts/verify-cors-config.js

# Should fail with wildcard
STORE_CORS="*" node scripts/verify-cors-config.js
```

2. **Production Testing**:
```bash
# Set production origins
export STORE_CORS="https://strike-shop.com"
export ADMIN_CORS="https://admin.strike-shop.com"
export AUTH_CORS="https://strike-shop.com"

# Validate
NODE_ENV=production node scripts/verify-cors-config.js
```

## Impact

- **Security**: Eliminates critical CORS vulnerability
- **Compliance**: Meets security audit requirements
- **Deployment**: Unblocks production deployment
- **Maintenance**: Automated validation prevents future issues

## Next Steps

1. Run validation scripts in CI/CD pipeline
2. Monitor CORS errors in production logs
3. Update origins when adding new frontend domains
4. Regular security audits of CORS configuration

## Conclusion

The CORS wildcard vulnerability has been completely eliminated. The system now enforces strict origin validation with no possibility of wildcards being used. Multiple layers of validation ensure this security configuration cannot be accidentally weakened.
