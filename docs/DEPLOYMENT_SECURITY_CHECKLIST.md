## Emergency Procedures

### 🚨 If Security Incident Detected

1. **Immediate Response**
   ```bash
   # Rotate potentially compromised secrets
   node scripts/generate-production-secrets.js
   
   # Check for exposed secrets
   node scripts/check-exposed-secrets.js
   
   # Validate environment
   node scripts/validate-env.js .env.production
   ```

2. **Investigation**
   - Review access logs
   - Check for unauthorized changes
   - Identify scope of breach
   - Document timeline

3. **Remediation**
   - Rotate all affected secrets
   - Patch vulnerabilities
   - Update security rules
   - Notify stakeholders

### 🔄 Secret Rotation Procedure

```bash
# 1. Generate new secrets
node scripts/generate-production-secrets.js

# 2. Update secret store (example for AWS)
aws secretsmanager update-secret \
  --secret-id strike-shop/production \
  --secret-string file://.env.production.secrets

# 3. Trigger deployment with new secrets
./deploy.sh --rotate-secrets

# 4. Verify new secrets are active
curl https://api.strike-shop.com/health

# 5. Archive old secrets (keep for audit)
```
