## Security Architecture

### Data Flow

```
User Login Attempt
      ↓
Rate Limiter Check → [Blocked if exceeded]
      ↓
Brute Force Check → [Blocked if locked/IP banned]
      ↓
CAPTCHA Verification → [Required if threshold met]
      ↓
Credential Validation → [Via Clerk]
      ↓
Session Creation → [Secure token generation]
      ↓
Activity Monitoring → [Suspicious pattern detection]
      ↓
Success Response → [With secure session cookie]
```

### Redis Storage Structure

```
Rate Limiting:
- auth:ip:{ip} → attempt count
- auth:email:{email} → attempt count

Brute Force:
- bruteforce:failed:{email} → failed count
- bruteforce:locked:{email} → lockout timestamp
- bruteforce:ip:{ip} → IP attempt count
- bruteforce:ipblock:{ip} → IP block flag

Sessions:
- session:{sessionId} → session data
- user:sessions:{userId} → session list

Monitoring:
- auth:events:{email}:{eventId} → event data
- auth:events:list:{email} → event timeline
- auth:events:stream → global event stream
```

## Security Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Failed Login Rate**: Target < 5%
2. **Account Lockout Rate**: Target < 0.1%
3. **Session Hijacking Incidents**: Target = 0

2. Monitor attack patterns
3. Adjust rate limits if needed
4. Alert security team
5. Consider temporary CAPTCHA for all users
6. Document attack details
