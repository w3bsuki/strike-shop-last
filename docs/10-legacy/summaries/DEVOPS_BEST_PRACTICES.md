# DevOps Best Practices Checklist - Next.js + Shopify Production

## 🏗️ Architecture & Code Quality

### Application Structure
- [ ] Use Next.js App Router with proper route groups
- [ ] Separate server and client components correctly
- [ ] Implement proper data fetching patterns (RSC for initial load)
- [ ] Use server actions for mutations where appropriate
- [ ] Proper TypeScript types for all data structures

### Component Architecture  
- [ ] Single source of truth for each component type
- [ ] Consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for components)
- [ ] Proper component composition and reusability
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns (UI, business logic, data)

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement proper caching strategies (ISR/On-demand revalidation)
- [ ] Use Next.js Image component for all images
- [ ] Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- [ ] Optimize bundle size (analyze with @next/bundle-analyzer)
- [ ] Use React Server Components for static content
- [ ] Implement proper loading states and Suspense boundaries

## 🔐 Security

### Environment & Secrets
- [ ] Never commit .env files (use .env.local)
- [ ] Use strong secret keys for all services
- [ ] Implement proper CORS policies
- [ ] Use environment variables for all API keys
- [ ] Separate staging and production environments

### API Security
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on all API routes
- [ ] Use proper authentication (JWT/Sessions)
- [ ] Validate all user inputs with Zod
- [ ] Implement CSRF protection
- [ ] Use secure headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- [ ] Sanitize all outputs to prevent XSS

### Shopify Integration Security
- [ ] Use Shopify Storefront API (not Admin API) for frontend
- [ ] Never expose admin API keys to client
- [ ] Implement webhook validation
- [ ] Use proper customer authentication flow

## 📦 Build & Deployment

### Build Configuration
- [ ] Optimize build for production (next build)
- [ ] Enable SWC minification
- [ ] Configure proper caching headers
- [ ] Implement proper error pages (404, 500)
- [ ] Set up health check endpoints

### CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] Automated testing on every PR
- [ ] Linting and type checking in CI
- [ ] Build verification before deploy
- [ ] Automated dependency updates (Dependabot)
- [ ] Staging environment for testing

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry/similar)
- [ ] Performance monitoring (Web Vitals)
- [ ] Uptime monitoring
- [ ] Structured logging
- [ ] Real User Monitoring (RUM)

## 🛒 Shopify-Specific Best Practices

### API Integration
