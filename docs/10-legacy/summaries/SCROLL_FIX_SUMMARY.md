# Product Section Scroll Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ProductCard Touch Event Blocking
**Problem**: ProductCard component was preventing scroll with conflicting touch-action policies and stopPropagation calls.

**Fixed**:
- Removed `touch-manipulation` class from main article element
- Changed all `e.stopPropagation()` calls to empty handlers that don't block scroll
- Removed `touch-manipulation` class from all AccessibleButton elements
- Kept `touchAction: 'pan-y'` in style to ensure vertical scrolling works

### 2. Enhanced Mobile Product Card Touch Interference  
**Problem**: Enhanced mobile card was blocking scroll with touch feedback and stopPropagation.

**Fixed**:
- Removed touch-feedback class that interfered with scroll
- Changed `e.stopPropagation()` calls to empty handlers
- Maintained vertical scroll capability with `touchAction: 'pan-y'`

### 3. Mobile Touch Target Component
**Problem**: Touch target wrapper was forcing `touch-action: manipulation` on all children.

**Fixed**:
- Made touch-action conditional: only use `manipulation` when `preventDoubleTap` is true
- Otherwise use `auto` to allow natural scrolling behavior

### 4. Global CSS Touch Action Conflicts
**Problem**: Multiple conflicting touch-action rules in globals.css were preventing proper scroll.

**Fixed**:
- Changed `html` element from `touch-action: pan-y` to `touch-action: auto`
- Changed `body` element from `touch-action: pan-y` to `touch-action: auto`
- Updated mobile section to use `touch-action: auto`
- Changed `.product-card` and `.product-card-image` to use `touch-action: pan-y`

### 5. Viewport Configuration
**Problem**: Viewport had `userScalable: false` and `maximumScale: 1.0` which could interfere with accessibility and touch handling.

**Fixed**:
- Changed `userScalable` to `true` for accessibility
- Changed `maximumScale` to `5.0` to allow proper zoom
- This improves accessibility and removes potential scroll conflicts

## Technical Details

### Touch Action Strategy
- **Global elements** (html, body): `touch-action: auto` - Allow all gestures
- **Product containers**: `touch-action: pan-y` - Allow vertical scroll, prevent horizontal interference  
- **Interactive buttons**: `touch-action: manipulation` - Only when preventing double-tap zoom
- **Horizontal scroll areas**: `touch-action: pan-x` - Only allow horizontal scroll

### Event Handling
- Removed all `e.stopPropagation()` calls from touch events that were blocking scroll
- Maintained click handlers for functionality while allowing scroll gestures to bubble up
- Preserved haptic feedback without interfering with scroll events

### Performance Optimizations
- Maintained GPU acceleration with `transform: translateZ(0)` where beneficial
- Kept `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` for iOS momentum scrolling
- Preserved `contain` CSS properties for layout stability

## Testing Verification

The following scroll behaviors should now work correctly:

1. **Vertical Page Scroll**: Users can scroll up/down through product sections without interference
2. **Product Card Interactions**: Buttons work normally without blocking scroll
3. **Horizontal Product Carousels**: Horizontal scrolling works independently of vertical scroll  
4. **Touch Target Sizing**: Minimum 48px touch targets maintained for accessibility
5. **iOS Safari Compatibility**: Proper momentum scrolling and touch handling
