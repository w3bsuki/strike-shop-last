# Product Display Components Modularization

## Overview
Successfully modularized the product display components following shadcn/ui patterns for maximum flexibility and composability.

## Components Created

### 1. ProductSection (`/components/product/product-section.tsx`)
- Container component with configurable spacing and background
- Variants: spacing (none, sm, default, lg), background (none, subtle, contrast, gradient)
- Follows shadcn's section pattern

### 2. ProductHeader (`/components/product/product-header.tsx`)
- Header component with title, description, and CTA
- Supports badge integration and alignment options
- Consistent with CategoryHeader pattern

### 3. ProductGrid (`/components/product/product-grid.tsx`)
- Responsive grid layout with configurable columns (2-6)
- Gap variants for different spacing needs
- Mobile-first responsive design

### 4. ProductScroll (`/components/product/product-scroll.tsx`)
- Horizontal scroll container with smooth navigation
- Optional controls with inside/outside positioning
- Performance optimized with CSS-only scrolling

### 5. ProductBadge (`/components/product/product-badge.tsx`)
- Versatile badge component for product status
- Variants: sale, new, soldOut, limited, exclusive
- Configurable size and positioning

### 6. ProductPrice (`/components/product/product-price.tsx`)
- Price display with original price support
- Size variants for different contexts
- Automatic currency formatting

### 7. ProductActions (`/components/product/product-actions.tsx`)
- Modular action buttons (wishlist, quick view, add to cart)
- Multiple layout options: horizontal, vertical, overlay
- Integrated with existing wishlist and quick view systems

### 8. ProductShowcase (`/components/product/product-showcase.tsx`)
- High-level composed component combining all primitives
- Supports both scroll and grid layouts
- Fully configurable with sensible defaults

## Configuration

Created `/config/products.ts` with centralized configuration for:
- Card sizes for different layouts
- Section presets (new arrivals, sale, etc.)
- Badge configurations
- Price display settings
- Performance optimizations

## Implementation

### Homepage Integration
Updated all 4 ProductScroll instances on the homepage to use the new ProductShowcase component with enhanced features:

1. **SS25 MENS SALE**: Added sale badge
2. **NEW ARRIVALS**: Added new badge
3. **FEATURED FOOTWEAR**: Added description
4. **KIDS COLLECTION**: Added description

### Backward Compatibility
The original ProductScroll component now acts as a wrapper around ProductShowcase, ensuring no breaking changes.

## Demo Pages Created

1. `/app/test/product-showcase/page.tsx` - Showcases different layout combinations
2. `/app/test/product-components/page.tsx` - Individual component demos

## Benefits

1. **Composability**: Mix and match components for custom layouts
2. **Consistency**: Follows established shadcn patterns
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to create new product display variations
4. **Performance**: Optimized with memoization and lazy loading
5. **Accessibility**: Full ARIA support and keyboard navigation
6. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns

## Usage Examples

### Basic Scroll Layout
```tsx
<ProductShowcase
  title="SALE ITEMS"
  products={products}
  viewAllLink="/sale"
  layout="scroll"
/>
```

### Grid with Badge
```tsx
<ProductShowcase
  title="NEW ARRIVALS"
  products={products}
  layout="grid"
  gridCols={4}
  showBadge
  badgeText="NEW"
  badgeVariant="new"
/>
```

### Custom Composed Layout
```tsx
<ProductSection spacing="lg" background="gradient">
  <ProductHeader title="EXCLUSIVE" align="center" />
  <ProductGrid cols={3}>
    {products.map(product => (
      <ProductCard key={product.id} product={product} />
    ))}
  </ProductGrid>
</ProductSection>
```

## Next Steps

1. Consider creating preset configurations for common use cases
2. Add animation variants for scroll and grid transitions
3. Implement skeleton loading states for each component
4. Add support for product comparison layouts
5. Create a ProductList component for vertical layouts
