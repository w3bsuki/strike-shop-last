**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Date**: December 2024
**Compliance Level**: PCI DSS Level 1 Ready

---

## 🔐 Security Features Implemented

### 1. Webhook Idempotency ✅

**Location**: `/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`

**Implementation**:
- Event deduplication using Redis/KV store with 24-hour TTL
- Unique event tracking by Stripe event ID
- Duplicate event detection and proper acknowledgment
- Request ID tracking for audit trails

**Key Features**:
```typescript
// Check if event already processed
const processedEvent = await kv.get<ProcessedEvent>(eventKey);
if (processedEvent) {
  return { received: true, duplicate: true };
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents duplicate payment processing
- Maintains transaction integrity
- Provides audit trail for webhook events

---

### 2. 3D Secure (3DS) Enforcement ✅

**Location**: `/lib/stripe-server.ts`

**Implementation**:
```typescript
payment_method_options: {

  },
}
```

**Thresholds**:
- £100+ transactions: 3DS required

    currency: 'gbp',
    items: [...],
    shipping: {...}
  })
});

const { clientSecret, security } = await response.json();
// Check security.requires3DS for 3D Secure requirement
```

### Processing a Refund
```typescript
const result = await SecureRefundService.processRefund({
  paymentIntentId: 'pi_xxx',
  amount: 5000, // £50 in pence
  reason: 'requested_by_customer',
  userId: 'user_123',
  metadata: {
    orderId: 'order_456',
