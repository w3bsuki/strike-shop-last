# Real Medusa Products Implementation

This document outlines the changes made to display real Medusa products instead of mock data throughout the Strike Shop application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Home Page (`app/page.tsx`)
- Updated the `getHomePageData` function to fetch real products from Medusa
- Enhanced the `convertProduct` function to properly handle Medusa product data including:
  - Variant IDs for cart functionality
  - Proper price formatting from Medusa's price structure
  - Product metadata (isNew, colors, etc.)
  - Categorization based on actual product categories
- Products are now filtered and categorized based on their real attributes:
  - New Arrivals: Products with `metadata.isNew = true`
  - Sale Items: Products with sale prices
  - Sneakers: Products in sneaker/footwear categories
  - Kids Items: Products in kids categories

### 2. Category Pages (`app/[category]/page.tsx`)
- Completely replaced mock product generation with real Medusa product fetching
- Added intelligent category matching:
  - Special handling for "new-arrivals" and "sale" categories
  - Matches Medusa categories by handle or name
  - Falls back to filtering products by title/description if no category match
- Proper product conversion with:
  - Real variant IDs
  - Actual pricing including sale prices
  - Inventory status (sold out detection)
  - Product metadata

### 3. Product Detail Pages (`app/product/[slug]/page.tsx`)
- Updated to use `MedusaProductService.getProduct()` method
- Fixed product fetching for both handle and ID lookups
- Maintains proper error handling and loading states

### 4. Product Card Component (`components/product/ProductCard.tsx`)
- Enhanced add-to-cart functionality to work with real Medusa products
- Properly handles variant IDs from product data
- Added proper error handling and user feedback via toasts
- Removed mock product demo mode logic

### 5. Type Updates (`types/home-page.ts`)
- Added `variantId` field to `HomePageProduct` interface
- This allows quick add-to-cart from product cards without fetching full product details

### 6. Testing Utilities
- Created `test-real-products.js` script to verify Medusa backend connectivity
- Helps debug product fetching and displays product/category information

## How It Works

1. **Product Fetching**: The `MedusaProductService` handles all communication with the Medusa backend
2. **Data Transformation**: Products are converted from Medusa format to the app's expected format
3. **Variant Handling**: Each product card receives the default variant ID for add-to-cart functionality
4. **Price Display**: Prices are properly formatted based on currency and include sale pricing
5. **Category Matching**: Dynamic category pages intelligently match URL slugs to Medusa categories

## Requirements for Production

1. **Medusa Backend**: Must be running and accessible
2. **Environment Variables**: 
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDUSA_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDUSA_REGION_ID`
3. **Seeded Products**: At least 5-6 products should be added to the Medusa backend
4. **Product Metadata**: For best results, products should have:
   - Proper categories assigned
   - Metadata for `isNew` flag
   - Multiple variants for color options
   - Thumbnails and images

## Testing

Run the test script to verify everything is working:

```bash
node test-real-products.js
```

This will show:
- Number of products found
- Product details including variants and pricing
- Available categories
- Any connection errors

## Next Steps

1. Ensure your Medusa backend has products seeded
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Test the application to see real products displayed
4. Consider adding more product metadata for better categorization
5. Optimize image URLs from Medusa or use a CDN for product images
