# Shopify Headless Integration Guide

## Overview
This project has been cleaned up and prepared for Shopify headless commerce integration. All previous backend services (Medusa, direct Stripe, database) have been removed.

## What Was Removed
- ✅ All Medusa backend files and configurations
- ✅ Direct Stripe payment integration
- ✅ Database connections (Prisma, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- ✅ All backend API routes
- ✅ Backend service files
- ✅ Unused dependencies

## Current State
- Frontend is using static/mock data
- Cart functionality uses localStorage
- Authentication still uses Supabase (can be kept or replaced with Shopify customer accounts)
- All components follow shadcn/ui best practices

## Next Steps for Shopify Integration

### 1. Set Up Shopify Store
- Create a Shopify store
- Install Headless channel
- Create a private app for Storefront API access

### 2. Get API Credentials
Add these to your `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=your-store.myshopify.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-access-token
```

### 3. Implement Shopify Services
The basic client is already created at `/lib/shopify/client.ts`. You'll need to add:

- Product fetching
- Collection/category fetching
- Cart management (using Shopify checkout)
- Customer accounts (optional)
- Order management

### 4. Update Components
Replace mock data in:
- `/app/page.tsx` - Home page products
- `/app/product/[slug]/page.tsx` - Product details
- `/app/[category]/page.tsx` - Category pages
- Cart functionality in `/lib/stores/slices/cart.ts`

### 5. Shopify Checkout
Shopify handles the entire checkout process. You'll redirect users to the Shopify checkout URL.

## File Structure
```
lib/
└── shopify/
    └── client.ts         # Basic Shopify client (ready to extend)
```
