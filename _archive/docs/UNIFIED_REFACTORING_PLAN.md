# 🎯 Strike Shop Unified Refactoring Plan

**Created**: January 2025  
**Objective**: Consolidate all refactoring strategies into one actionable plan  
**Philosophy**: Fix critical issues first, then enhance systematically

## 📊 Overview

This plan unifies three overlapping refactoring strategies:
1. PRODUCTION_REFACTOR_PLAN.md (8-hour emergency fixes)
