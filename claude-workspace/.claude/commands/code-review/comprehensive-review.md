# Comprehensive Multi-Agent Code Review Workflow

## 🎯 Overview

This workflow orchestrates all specialized agents to perform a thorough, production-ready code review that covers all aspects of software quality.

## 🚀 Agent Coordination Strategy

**Orchestrator Role**: Analyze the codebase and delegate specialized review tasks to appropriate agents in parallel for maximum efficiency.

**Parallel Execution**: Launch multiple agents simultaneously to review different aspects, then synthesize results into actionable recommendations.

## 📋 Multi-Agent Review Process

### Phase 1: Codebase Analysis & Agent Assignment
```markdown
**Orchestrator Analysis:**
1. Detect project type (frontend, backend, full-stack)
