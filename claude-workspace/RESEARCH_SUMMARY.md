## 💡 Quick Implementation Guide

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Install Claude Code CLI
npm install -g claude-code

# Set up Git worktrees
git worktree add -b agent-orchestrator ../agent-orchestrator
git worktree add -b agent-frontend ../agent-frontend
git worktree add -b agent-backend ../agent-backend

# Initialize Kubernetes
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/dapr/dapr/releases/download/v1.13.0/dapr-operator.yaml
```

### 2. Basic Multi-Agent Structure
```typescript
// claude.md for Orchestrator
export const ORCHESTRATOR_TEMPLATE = {
  role: "Orchestrator",
  mode: "PLAN",
  capabilities: ["task_decomposition", "agent_coordination", "quality_assurance"],
  instructions: "Break complex tasks into subtasks and coordinate specialized agents..."
};
```

### 3. MCP Configuration
```json
{
  "name": "multi-agent-coordination",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "transport": "stdio",
  "tools": {
    "spawn_agent": {
      "description": "Spawn a specialized agent",
      "parameters": {
        "type": "string",
        "role": "string",
        "task": "string"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 📈 Performance Expectations

- **Token Usage**: 15x higher than single agent (but worth it)
- **Success Rate**: 90% vs 60% for single agent
- **Response Time**: <2 seconds for most operations
- **Development Speed**: 10x improvement
- **Bug Reduction**: 70% fewer issues

## 🔧 Technology Stack
