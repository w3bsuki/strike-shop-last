```

## 🎯 Quick Start

### 1. Setup Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the claude-workspace directory:
```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/devdb
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
```

### 2. Launch Claude Code
```bash
cd claude-workspace
claude
```

### 3. Start a New Project
```bash
# Create a Next.js application with all agents working in parallel
claude "Create a production-ready Next.js SaaS application with authentication, database, and deployment pipeline"

# The orchestrator will:
# 1. Analyze requirements
# 2. Launch specialized agents in parallel
# 3. Coordinate their outputs
# 4. Deliver a complete, production-ready application
```

## 📚 Best Practices

1. **Always use ultrathink** for architectural decisions
2. **Leverage parallel execution** for complex tasks
3. **Let agents specialize** in their domains
4. **Use memory MCP** to persist important context
5. **Follow the orchestrator pattern** for coordination

## 🤝 Contributing
