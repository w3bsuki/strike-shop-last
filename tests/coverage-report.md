## Implementation Strategy

### Quick Wins (Immediate)
1. Fix failing tests by properly mocking Next.js 14 features
2. Add missing methods to store implementations
3. Set up proper test environment variables

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
1. Focus on critical business logic tests
2. Implement API route testing with proper mocks
3. Complete component interaction tests

### Medium Term (3-4 weeks)
1. Achieve 80% coverage on all critical paths
2. Implement visual regression tests
3. Set up continuous integration checks

### Long Term (1-2 months)
1. Maintain 80%+ coverage requirement
2. Implement mutation testing
3. Performance regression testing

## Test Infrastructure Recommendations

### 1. Testing Tools Enhancement
- Add `@testing-library/react-hooks` for better hook testing
- Implement `msw` for API mocking
- Add `jest-axe` for accessibility testing

### 2. CI/CD Integration
- Block deployments if coverage < 80%
- Run tests on every PR
- Generate coverage reports automatically

### 3. Developer Experience
- Add pre-commit hooks for test execution
- Provide test templates and examples
- Create testing documentation

## Conclusion

The current 1.4% test coverage represents a critical risk to the Strike Shop platform. Immediate action is required to:

1. Fix failing tests and establish a stable testing baseline
2. Focus on critical business logic (payments, cart, products)
3. Systematically increase coverage to reach 80% target
4. Implement quality gates to maintain coverage

The recommended 4-week sprint plan will bring coverage from 1.4% to 80%, significantly reducing bugs and improving code quality. The investment in testing will pay dividends through reduced production issues and faster development cycles.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix the 17 failing tests
2. **Today**: Start with Payment API tests (highest risk)
3. **This Week**: Achieve 40% coverage on critical paths
4. **This Month**: Reach 80% overall coverage target
