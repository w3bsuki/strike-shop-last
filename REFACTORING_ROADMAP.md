# Strike Shop Refactoring Roadmap

## Executive Summary
This roadmap outlines the systematic refactoring of the Strike Shop codebase to achieve production-grade quality. Based on our comprehensive audit, we've identified critical areas requiring immediate attention and created a phased approach to address technical debt while maintaining development velocity.

## Current State Analysis
- **TypeScript Issues**: 18 files with `any` types, compromising type safety
- **Code Duplication**: Multiple store implementations and repeated business logic
- **Bundle Size**: Excessive dependencies and unused components
- **Architecture Debt**: Large monolithic services violating single responsibility
- **Security Gaps**: Missing API rate limiting and authorization layers

## Refactoring Phases

### Phase 1: Critical Issues (Week 1)
**Goal**: Fix security vulnerabilities and type safety

#### 1.1 TypeScript Type Safety
- [ ] Create comprehensive type definitions for all API responses
- [ ] Replace all `any` types with proper interfaces
- [ ] Implement type guards for runtime validation
- [ ] Add strict mode to tsconfig.json

**Files to refactor**:
- `/lib/data-service.ts` (11 any types)
- `/lib/medusa-service.ts` (8 any types)
- `/components/product-scroll.tsx`
- `/app/checkout/page.tsx`

#### 1.2 Security Hardening
- [ ] Add rate limiting middleware for API routes
- [ ] Implement proper CORS configuration
- [ ] Add authorization middleware for admin routes
- [ ] Secure webhook endpoints with signature verification

#### 1.3 Store Consolidation
- [ ] Merge `cart-store.ts` and `cart-store-optimized.ts`
- [ ] Merge `auth-store.ts` and `auth-store-production.ts`
- [ ] Remove duplicate implementations
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for stores

### Phase 2: Code Organization (Week 2)
**Goal**: Improve maintainability and reduce complexity

#### 2.1 Service Layer Refactoring
- [ ] Split `data-service.ts` into smaller, focused services:
  - `product-service.ts` - Product data operations
  - `sync-service.ts` - Medusa-Sanity synchronization
  - `price-service.ts` - Price formatting and calculations
  - `image-service.ts` - Image optimization and fallbacks
- [ ] Create shared utilities for common operations
- [ ] Implement proper dependency injection

#### 2.2 Component Refactoring
- [ ] Extract business logic from page components
- [ ] Create custom hooks for data fetching
- [ ] Implement proper loading and error boundaries
- [ ] Standardize component prop interfaces

#### 2.3 Clean Up
- [ ] Remove all Zone.Identifier files
- [ ] Add proper .gitignore entries
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies
- [ ] Delete unused UI components

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization (Week 3)
**Goal**: Improve load times and user experience

#### 3.1 Bundle Optimization
- [ ] Implement code splitting for routes
- [ ] Tree-shake unused UI components
- [ ] Lazy load heavy components
- [ ] Optimize image loading with blur placeholders

#### 3.2 Data Layer Optimization
- [ ] Implement React Query for caching
- [ ] Add optimistic updates for cart operations
- [ ] Parallelize independent data fetches
- [ ] Add proper Suspense boundaries

#### 3.3 Build Configuration
- [ ] Configure Webpack optimization
- [ ] Enable CSS purging for production
- [ ] Implement critical CSS inlining
- [ ] Add bundle size monitoring

### Phase 4: Feature Completion (Week 4)
**Goal**: Complete missing functionality

#### 4.1 Core Features
- [ ] Implement product search with filters
- [ ] Complete wishlist functionality
- [ ] Add guest checkout flow
- [ ] Implement order tracking

#### 4.2 Admin Features
- [ ] Add inventory management UI
- [ ] Create analytics dashboard
- [ ] Implement bulk operations
- [ ] Add order management features

#### 4.3 User Experience
- [ ] Add product reviews system
- [ ] Implement size guide integration
- [ ] Create saved addresses feature
- [ ] Add order history page

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Standards
```typescript
// ❌ Bad - using any
const processProduct = (data: any) => {
  return data.variants.map((v: any) => v.price)
}

// ✅ Good - proper types
interface Product {
  variants: ProductVariant[]
}
interface ProductVariant {
  price: Money
}
const processProduct = (data: Product) => {
  return data.variants.map(v => v.price)
}
```

### File Structure
```
lib/
├── services/
│   ├── product/
│   │   ├── product-service.ts
│   │   ├── product-types.ts
│   │   └── product-utils.ts
│   ├── cart/
│   ├── auth/
│   └── payment/
├── hooks/
│   ├── use-products.ts
│   ├── use-cart.ts
│   └── use-auth.ts
└── utils/
    ├── format-price.ts
    ├── validate-email.ts
    └── constants.ts
```

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all services and utilities
- Integration tests for API routes
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Performance benchmarks for key pages

## Success Metrics
- **Type Coverage**: 100% (currently ~60%)
- **Bundle Size**: <500KB (currently ~800KB)
- **Lighthouse Score**: 90+ (currently ~70)
- **Test Coverage**: 80%+ (currently ~30%)
- **Build Time**: <2 minutes (currently ~4 minutes)

## Migration Strategy
1. **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags for gradual rollout
2. **Parallel Development**: Keep old code during transition
3. **Incremental Updates**: Deploy improvements continuously
4. **Rollback Plan**: Maintain ability to revert changes

## Risk Mitigation
- **Breaking Changes**: Use adapter pattern for API changes
- **Performance Regression**: Monitor metrics after each deployment
- **User Impact**: A/B test major changes
- **Data Loss**: Implement proper backup strategies

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Critical fixes (security, types)
- **Week 2**: Code organization and cleanup
- **Week 3**: Performance optimization
- **Week 4**: Feature completion
- **Week 5**: Testing and documentation
- **Week 6**: Production deployment

## Dependencies
- Upgrade to latest stable versions
- Remove unused packages
- Add missing dev dependencies
- Document all dependency choices

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve this roadmap
2. Set up monitoring and metrics
3. Create feature branches for each phase
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation
5. Schedule daily progress reviews
