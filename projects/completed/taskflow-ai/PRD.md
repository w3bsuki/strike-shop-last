# Product Requirements Document: TaskFlow AI

## üöÄ Executive Summary

**TaskFlow AI** is an intelligent task management platform that revolutionizes team productivity through AI-powered prioritization, real-time collaboration, and predictive scheduling. By combining cutting-edge AI with intuitive design, TaskFlow AI helps teams work 40% more efficiently.

## üéØ Vision Statement

"Empower teams to focus on what matters most by intelligently organizing, prioritizing, and predicting task workflows."

## üîç Problem Statement

Current task management tools are static and require manual effort to:
- Prioritize tasks based on impact and urgency
- Schedule work based on team capacity
- Track progress across multiple projects
- Identify bottlenecks before they impact deadlines
- Balance workload across team members

Teams waste 30% of their time on task management overhead instead of actual work.
