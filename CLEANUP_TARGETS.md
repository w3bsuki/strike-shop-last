# Strike Shop - Comprehensive Cleanup Targets

**Generated by Claude Code - Last Updated: December 30, 2024**

This document identifies unused code, files, and assets that can be safely deleted from the Strike Shop codebase. Each item includes reasoning and impact assessment.

---

## üö® HIGH PRIORITY - Immediate Cleanup

### Unused Dependencies (package.json)

These dependencies should be removed as they're not imported anywhere in the codebase:

```json
// REMOVE from dependencies:
"@emotion/is-prop-valid": "^1.3.1",     // Not used - searched entire codebase
"@vercel/kv": "^3.0.0",                 // Not used - no KV storage implementation
"jose": "^6.0.11",                      // Not used - no JWT functionality found  
"react-is": "^18.3.1",                  // Not used - no React type checking found
```

**Impact**: ~50KB reduction in bundle size, faster npm install times

### Unused DevDependencies (package.json)

```json
// REMOVE from devDependencies:
"axe-core": "^4.10.2",                  // Not used directly
"jest-axe": "^9.0.0",                   // Not used - no accessibility tests found
"msw": "^2.6.4",                        // Not used - no API mocking found
```

**Impact**: Faster development builds, reduced node_modules size

## üíÄ DEAD CODE - Files Never Imported

### Legacy Components

```bash
# DELETE these files:
components/product/ProductCard.old.tsx               # Legacy version, never imported
```

**Reasoning**: 
- `ProductCard.old.tsx` is 309 lines but has zero imports
- Optimized version exists and is used instead
- Safe to delete immediately

### Unused Dynamic Import Exports

```bash
# CLEAN UP in lib/dynamic-imports.tsx:
- DynamicLineChart     # Exported but never imported
- DynamicBarChart      # Exported but never imported  
- DynamicPieChart      # Exported but never imported
- DynamicCarousel      # Exported but never imported
```

**Impact**: File serves only as documentation - consider converting to pure docs

---

## üìÅ EMPTY ARCHITECTURE - Planned But Unimplemented

### Entire Features Directory Structure

```bash
# DELETE these empty directories:
features/auth/components/
features/auth/hooks/
features/auth/services/
features/auth/types/
features/auth/utils/
features/cart/components/
features/cart/hooks/
features/cart/services/
features/cart/types/
features/cart/utils/
features/catalog/components/
features/catalog/hooks/
features/catalog/services/
features/catalog/types/
features/catalog/utils/
features/checkout/components/
features/checkout/hooks/
features/checkout/services/
features/checkout/types/
features/checkout/utils/
features/customer/components/
features/customer/hooks/
features/customer/services/
features/customer/types/
features/customer/utils/
```

### Shared Directory Structure

```bash
# DELETE these empty directories:
shared/components/ui/
shared/hooks/
shared/types/
shared/utils/
```

**Reasoning**: 
- All directories are completely empty
- No code references this intended architecture
- Can be recreated if/when feature-based architecture is implemented

**Impact**: Cleaner project structure, reduced mental overhead

## ‚öôÔ∏è BROKEN CONFIGURATION

### Missing Scripts Referenced in package.json

These script files are referenced but don't exist:

```bash
# Scripts referenced in package.json but missing:
scripts/analyze-bundle.js               # Line 17, 18, 43
scripts/check-bundle-size.js            # Line 19
scripts/validate-production-env.js      # Line 53  
scripts/optimize-fonts-simple.js        # Line 62
scripts/optimize-fonts.js               # Line 63
scripts/optimize-assets.js              # Line 64
scripts/optimize-bundle.js              # Line 44
scripts/wcag-validation.js              # Line 49
scripts/test-coverage.js                # Line 40
```

**Action Required**: Either create these scripts or remove the npm scripts that reference them

### Missing Test Configuration

```bash
# Test configs referenced but missing:
jest.config.frontend.js                 # Lines 21-24, 39
jest.config.unit.js                     # Line 25
jest.config.integration.js              # Line 26  
jest.config.component.js                # Lines 27, 38
jest.config.domain.js                   # Line 28
```

**Action Required**: Create test configs or remove test scripts

### Missing Build Configuration

```bash
# Build configs referenced but missing:
tsconfig.production.json                # Line 9 build:prod script
k6/                                      # Lines 54-57 load test scripts
.lighthouserc.*                          # Lines 47-48 lighthouse scripts
```

**Action Required**: Create configs or remove related scripts

## üîß CONFIGURATION DUPLICATES

### PostCSS Configuration

```bash
# EVALUATE: postcss.config.optimized.mjs
```

**Issue**: Uses plugins not in package.json:
- `postcss-import`
- `postcss-preset-env` 
- `cssnano`

**Options**:
1. Delete if unused
2. Add missing dependencies if it should be used
3. Rename as `postcss.config.example.mjs`

### Tailwind Configuration

```bash
# EVALUATE: tailwind.config.optimized.ts
```

**Analysis**: 
- Uses advanced CSS variable system with design tokens
- References `/styles/tokens/design-tokens.css` (exists)
- May be intended as the future config
- Current `tailwind.config.ts` is actively used

**Recommendation**: Keep both for now, but clarify which is production

---

## üé® UNUSED ASSETS ANALYSIS

### Images - All Currently Used

```bash
# KEEP all images in public/images/:
public/images/hero-image.png            # Used in SEO metadata
public/images/product-grid.png          # Used in SEO metadata  
public/images/hero/*                    # Strike SS25 hero images used
```

**Status**: All images have references - no cleanup needed

---

## üß™ POTENTIALLY UNUSED COMPONENTS

### Admin Dashboard Legacy

```bash
# INVESTIGATE: components/admin/AdminDashboard.tsx
```

**Analysis**:
- Non-optimized version exists
- `AdminDashboardOptimized.tsx` is used in production
- Legacy version referenced in `lib/dynamic-components.ts` but may not be used
- **Recommendation**: Audit actual usage before deletion

### Multiple Hero Implementations

```bash
# INVESTIGATE hero component overlap:
components/hero-section.tsx              # Simple hero (currently used)
components/hero/hero-section.tsx         # Complex compound hero 
components/hero/simple-hero.tsx          # Another simple implementation
```

**Analysis**:
- `components/hero-section.tsx` is actively used in main page
- `components/hero/` directory has compound component system
- May be planned migration - investigate before cleanup

---

## üìã CLEANUP EXECUTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Immediate Safe Deletions (30 minutes)

1. **Remove unused dependencies from package.json**
2. **Delete empty feature/shared directories** 
3. **Delete ProductCard.old.tsx**
4. **Run npm install to update lock file**

### Phase 2: Script and Config Audit (1 hour)

1. **Audit package.json scripts** - remove or create missing files
2. **Review test configuration needs**
3. **Evaluate configuration duplicates**

### Phase 3: Component Analysis (2 hours)

1. **Admin dashboard usage audit**
2. **Hero component consolidation**
3. **Dynamic imports cleanup**

### Phase 4: Final Verification (30 minutes)

1. **Run build to ensure nothing breaks**
2. **Run tests (when configured)**
3. **Update documentation**

---

## üöÄ EXPECTED BENEFITS

### Bundle Size Reduction
- **Dependencies**: ~50KB reduction
- **Dead code**: ~15KB reduction
- **Unused assets**: 0KB (all used)

### Developer Experience
- **Faster installs**: Fewer dependencies
- **Cleaner structure**: No empty directories
- **Reduced confusion**: Clear component hierarchy

### Maintenance Benefits
- **Fewer breaking changes**: Less code to update
- **Better IDE performance**: Fewer files to index
- **Clearer architecture**: Remove planning artifacts

## ‚ö†Ô∏è SAFETY CHECKLIST

Before deleting any file:

- [ ] Search entire codebase for imports
- [ ] Check dynamic imports and lazy loading
- [ ] Verify no string-based references (e.g., in configs)
- [ ] Test build process after changes
- [ ] Verify no runtime loading (e.g., Next.js dynamic imports)

---

## üìù NOTES

1. **Test Configuration**: The missing Jest configs suggest testing setup is incomplete. Consider implementing proper test structure before cleanup.

2. **Feature Architecture**: The empty features/ structure suggests a planned feature-based architecture that wasn't implemented. Document the intended structure before deletion.

3. **Configuration Strategy**: Multiple config files (optimized versions) suggest an ongoing optimization effort. Clarify which configs are production-ready.

4. **Dynamic Imports**: Some components are imported via dynamic imports which may not show up in static analysis. Always test build after cleanup.
